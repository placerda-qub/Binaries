% The simulations of its survival indicate that the disk had to have been dispersed by migrating planets within ≲100 Myr of t0. This constraint implies that the planetary migration is unrelated to the formation of the youngest lunar basins.

% We find that 67P could be a primordial body (i.e., not a collisional fragment) if the outer planetesimal disk lasted ≲10 Myr before it was dispersed by migrating Neptune. The probability of binary collapse by impact is ≃30% for tightly bound binaries. Most km-class binaries become collisionally dissolved. Roughly 10% of the surviving binaries later evolve to become contact binaries during the disk dispersal, when bodies suffer gravitational encounters with Neptune. Overall, the processes described in this work do not seem to be efficient enough to explain the large fraction (̃67%) of bi-lobed cometary nuclei inferred from spacecraft imaging.
